Maximum impact, zero waste




Transparent and Genuine Charity Application
Many fake charity organizations pose as genuine and steal money from innocent people in the name of charity. Most people want to donate money to a good cause, but they are unsure if the money is going to reach the right hands of those in need. Blockchain, more specifically the Ethereum blockchain through its smart contracts, can bring transparency to online charities. Contributors can see the journey of the donation in realtime and confirm if it’s reaching the deserving hands or not.

For our project, we wanted to create an organization that streamlines donations to charities using smart contracts, a chatbot to communicate basic answers and status updates, as well as processing the transactions with verification available via the blockchain. 

We created smart contracts that allows for transactions to go to 1 of the 2 charities we set up called “Woof World” and “Kababayanihan”.
