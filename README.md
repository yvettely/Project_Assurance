Transparent and Genuine Charity Application
Many fake charity organizations pose as genuine and loot money from innocent people in the name of charity. Most people want to donate money to a good cause of charity, but they are unsure if the money is going to reach the right hands of the destitute. The blockchain system can bring transparency to online charity trusts. Contributors can see the journey of the donation in realtime and confirm if it’s reaching the deserving hands or not.

Within our project we wanted to create and organization that streamlines donations to charities using smart contracts, uses a chatbot to communicate basic answers and status updates as well as processing the transactions with verification available via the blockchain. 

The first step was to create the smart contract this would allow for transactions to go to 1 of the 2 charities we set up called “Woof World” or “Kababayanihan”.
